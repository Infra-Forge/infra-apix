# Pre-commit hook for apix - OpenAPI spec drift detection
#
# This hook prevents commits that would cause the OpenAPI spec to drift
# from the actual code implementation.
#
# Installation:
#   make install-hooks
#   # OR manually:
#   cp .githooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
#   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
#
# To bypass this hook (NOT RECOMMENDED):
#   git commit --no-verify
#
